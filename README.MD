# Pure Levenshtein Distance Algorithm vs Damerau–Levenshtein Distance Algorithm
The pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm may be a more effective solution than the Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario because it only considers insertions, deletions, and substitutions as operations needed to transform one string into another, while the Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm includes transpositions. In the case of comparing two names, transpositions are less likely to occur than other types of operations, and therefore, it may be more efficient to use the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm.
